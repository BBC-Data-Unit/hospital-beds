In March 2017 we [reported](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-39258606) that more than 2,500 hospital beds a day are taken up by patients whose release has been delayed due to problems in the social care system. We looked at delays caused by social care pressures. This could be delays in getting a home care package or nursing home placement.

* On average, there are 12 days lost per 1,000 people aged 18 and over across 151 areas.
* There are wide variations across the country. Cumbria County Council had the highest rate of delays in England, with 78 days per 1,000 people.
* Delays due entirely to social care have more than doubled in the past five years.

The story was based on data compiled from monthly [NHS England statistics on delayed transfers of care](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/delayed-transfers-of-care/).
